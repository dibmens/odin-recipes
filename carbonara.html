    <h3>Carbonara, the 'ol' reliable' of our household</h3>
    <p>A delicious peppery carbonara is but few dry scraps of cured meats and half empty bags of various pastas collecting dust in the pantry away.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div id="recipe">
        <ul>
            <li>250g cured meats, preferably with some fat in them. The deeper red the meat, the better</li>
            <li>500g pasta, any pasta, just throw it all in</li>
            <li>If you're feeling naughty, some cloves of garlic, crushed, to taste</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper, to taste (then multiply by 10)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice and fry up the meat with a heavy helping of black pepper, don't be shy, top with crushed garlic, if you chose to have it</li>
            <li>Put the pasta on boil, until al dente </li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, but leave a little bit of pasta water in it. It will form the basis of your sauce. Pour it in a big bowl</li>
            <li>Mix in the meat.</li>
            <li>Beat one large egg with a little bit of salt. We poured the pasta and ham in the bowl so it cools faster and our egg doesn't fry. Mix the egg in the bowl until everything is glazed in shiny uniform sauce of egg and pasta-water</li>
            <li>Throw on some more pepper, salt to taste and grate over it all a nice hard cheese of the parmesan kind. Or just an old dried up gouda, whatever you have. The dinner is served</li>
        </ol>
    </div>    
    <h2>Keep it simple, stupid</h2>
    <p>Italians need that one special pepper cure, anglos want to drench it all in heavy cream. Don't over-think it. As long as you have the peppery and salty play in wet pasta, you have a fine carbonara that just saved you a trip to grocery store. </p>
    <h3>Buon appetito!</h3>
